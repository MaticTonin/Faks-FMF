abstract = {Light propagation can be controlled with plasmonic interfaces that introduce abrupt phase shifts along the optical path. Conventional optical components rely on gradual phase shifts accumulated during light propagation to shape light beams. New degrees of freedom are attained by introducing abrupt phase changes over the scale of the wavelength. A two-dimensional array of optical resonators with spatially varying phase response and subwavelength separation can imprint such phase discontinuities on propagating light as it traverses the interface between two media. Anomalous reflection and refraction phenomena are observed in this regime in optically thin arrays of metallic antennas on silicon with a linear phase variation along the interface, which are in excellent agreement with generalized laws derived from Fermat’s principle. Phase discontinuities provide great flexibility in the design of light beams, as illustrated by the generation of optical vortices through use of planar designer metallic interfaces.}}

abstract = {Abstract Metasurfaces, the 2D counterpart of artificial metamaterials, have attracted much attention because of their exceptional ability to manipulate the electromagnetic wave such as amplitude, phase, polarization, propagation direction, and so on. Different from conventional lenses, metalenses based on the metasurface optics are truly flat and compact and exhibit superior performance. In this report, recent progress in the development of metalenses is explored. First, the working principle and characteristics of metalenses are discussed. Then, it is described how the dispersion aberration in metalenses can be eliminated to make them suitable for being employed in a range of applications that are difficult or impossible for traditional lenses. In addition, various metalens-based applications are introduced, including imaging, high spectral resolution spectroscopy, and multiplex color routing. Furthermore, a survey of reconfigurable and tunable metalenses is conducted. Finally, the report concludes by addressing future prospects of metalenses.},
